h1. Scorekeeper

Scorekeeper is a simple CLI app that enables you to replace paper for keeping scores. It's cool for periodic ritual card games with friends and families, for example.
The major benefits are convenient access to game history and game analysis. 

h2. Requirements

Scorekeeper requires Ruby 1.8+, SQLite3 and the sqlite3 and active-record gems.

Scorekeeper has only been tested in Mac OSX 10.5+ -- please let me know if you run it successfully or unsuccessfully elsewhere.

h2. Getting started

# Download the source code 
# Open up a terminal window and _cd_ into the downloaded folder
# Type _ruby scorekeeper.rb_ and hit Enter

h2. Making Scorekeeper better

Scorekeeper is sort of MVC. The Views are written within the _app/controllers.rb_ file and getting them out of there with a pretty CLI helper would be a great improvement.

Scorekeeper's logic is very basic and I'd like to have the ability to add logic for specific types of games.

If you want to help, fork away or send your patches. Bug fixes and other contributions are welcome too. 
Thanks!
